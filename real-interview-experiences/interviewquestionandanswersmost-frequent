Core Fundamentals & OOP
Four Pillars of OOP: Explain Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism with real-world examples.
Interface vs. Abstract Class: An interface is a contract (usually for "can-do" behaviors), while an abstract class is for "is-a" relationships and can hold state.
== vs. equals(): == compares memory references; .equals() compares the actual content of objects.
Why are Strings Immutable? To ensure security, thread safety, and to optimize memory via the String Pool.
JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM: JDK is for development; JRE provides the environment to run apps; JVM executes the bytecode. 
Collections & Data Structures
HashMap Internal Working: Uses hashing to store key-value pairs in "buckets." Be ready to explain hash collisions and how Java 8+ uses balanced trees for optimization.
ArrayList vs. LinkedList: ArrayList is faster for random access (index-based), while LinkedList is better for frequent insertions or deletions.
Fail-Fast vs. Fail-Safe Iterators: Fail-fast throws a ConcurrentModificationException if the collection changes during iteration; fail-safe works on a copy. 
Multithreading & Concurrency
Thread vs. Runnable: You can create a thread by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface (preferred for better code design).
Synchronized Method vs. Block: A synchronized method locks the entire object, while a block provides granular control by locking only a specific code section.
Deadlock: A situation where two threads are waiting for each other to release locks forever. Prevent this by acquiring locks in a consistent order.
Volatile Keyword: Ensures a variable's value is always read from and written to main memory, preventing thread-local caching issues. 
Java 8+ Features
Lambda Expressions: Anonymous functions that implement functional interfaces, making code more concise.
Stream API: Used for functional-style processing of collections (e.g., filter, map, reduce).
Optional Class: A container object used to avoid NullPointerException by explicitly representing the presence or absence of a value. 
Advanced & Modern Java (Java 11–21)
Virtual Threads (Java 21): Lightweight threads that significantly reduce the resource overhead of high-concurrency applications.
Garbage Collection Algorithms: Be familiar with G1 (standard for most) and newer low-latency collectors like ZGC.
